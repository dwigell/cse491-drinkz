Al Coholic wants to go to a party, but admission to the party requires
him to bring a bottle of alcohol that isn't already going to be
there. Luckily, Al can look up what people are bringing to the
party.

Scenario One:
He finds the party on the 'parties' page of the
website. Unfortunately, the average drink rating for the party is way
above any of those in his drink cabinet and way above his price range.
So Al appropriately decides not to go.

Scenario Two:
He finds the party on the 'parties' page of the
website. Unfortunately, the average drink rating for the party is way
above any of those in his drink cabinet and way above his price range.
So, Al Coholic being Al Coholic, scours the party page for a more
acceptable party to go to.

Scenario Three:
He finds the party on the 'parties' page of the website. The party's
average drink rating is well within his capabilities, so Al decides to

is bringing Jack Daniel's whiskey. So, Al adds his name and his
whiskey to the guest list.(Al should delete his whiskey from his
cabinet in order to keep his records accurate)
