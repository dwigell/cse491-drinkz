I created a function in drinkz.load_bulk_data.py called
load_recipes which works in a similar way to load_bottle_types
and load_inventory. Each line in the file is read as a recipe where
the name of the recipe is the first value of the line. All values
after the first correspond to the liquor ingredients and their
amounts respectively.
I then wrote a script in the bin directory called load-liquor-recipes
which utilizes the function load_recipes.

To load bulk recipes:
   python load-liquor-recipes filename

In your file that you decide to load, make sure that you separate the
name, ingredient names, and ingredient amounts with commas

EXAMPLE:

	recipe name, ingredient 1, amount 1, ingredient 2, amount 2
