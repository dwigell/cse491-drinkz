Run the server by running the command:
    python2.7 server.py

Connect your client by using the host and port number
assigned to the server.

I used grab-page as my primary test client.
An example of what I did to test my server could be...

python2.7 grab-page arctic.cse.msu.edu 8089
	  	       ^	        ^
		       host	       port

After running run-web for a while I noticed that the GET
command consisted of "GET /somepath HTTP/1.1". So, in order
to format this string so that it properly calls the correct
wsgi function, I got rid of any unneccesary whitespace and
the GET and HTTP/1.1
I then run the wsgi app and then send the status and html back
to the client.
